/* DISPERSE.C - Program to "disperse" the information from an
input file into a number of output files.
Author: Peter Pearson.
Version of 93.02.15.

This program implements a "Threshhold Information Protection Scheme",
as described in D.E.R. Denning, Cryptography and Data Security, pp. 179 -
182. Since I had a byte-oriented mind, I chose to use arithmetic
over 4-bit entities (GF(2^4)), which allows dispersal into as many
as 15 files but still allows multiplication and division to be performed
by table lookup.

So, the general scheme is this: From the original plaintext file,
W "shadow" files are produced, any T of which can be "combined" to
reproduce the original plaintext file. (W and T are integers of the
user's choice, not to exceed 15.) The assertion of this package is that
it is impossible to derive the original plaintext file from any T-1
of the "shadow" files. (The validity of that assertion depends solely
and vitally on the inscrutability of the random numbers used by the
dispersal algorithm.)

At a more detailed level: The plaintext file is read nibble-by-nibble,
a nibble being 4 bits. For each nibble P read from the plaintext file,
one nibble is written into each "shadow" file, according to this recipe:
T-1 4-bit coefficients C(i), 0 < i < T, are chosen randomly. For "shadow"
file number j, 0 < j <= W, we compute the polynomial

     y = P + C(1) * j + C(2) * j**2 + ... + C(T-1) * j**(T-1),

using GF(2^4) arithmetic, and write it into the "shadow" file.
Reconstruction of the plaintext file is possible because, given the
corresponding nibble from each of T of the shadow files, you have T
(j, y) points on a polynomial of degree T-1, and can determine the
polynomial completely. (GF(2^4) arithmetic has the attractive features
of limiting all numbers to 4 bits while preserving all the algebraic
properties necessary for familiar polynomial interpolation.)

Final detail: Each shadow file must include two crucial parameters
of the particular "dispersal": (1) the number, T, of shadow files
needed for reconstruction; and (2) the index "j" that was used in
computing the nibbles written into that particular shadow file.
These two values are written into the first two bytes of the shadow
file.

Algorithm:

     If a file exists already with any of these names, it will

Important note:
     The output from this program will resist intelligent, informed

     resists analysis. If the random number sequence is truly random,
     as could be achieved by attaching special hardware to your
     computer, then the output from this program will resist decryption
     even by an infinitely-intelligent cryptanalyst knowing all the
     algorithms involved.
         Such perfection is not likely to be achieved. Second-best is
     a pseudorandom-number generator whose future outputs cannot be
     predicted even when given a long sequence of past outputs. Any
     encryption scheme (e.g. DES) resistant to known-plaintext attack
     might be harnessed to this purpose.

         This version of this program, however, settles for a very
     predictable pseudorandom-number generator.
